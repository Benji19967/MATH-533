As we can see from the histograms below, the distribution of the beta.1
with Cauchy distributed random error is similar to the one with Normal
distributed random error around the true value of beta.1, however there
are more values that are far from the true value. This is because the
Cauchy distribution is tail heavy. Furthermore, the Cauchy distribution
has no defined Mean and Variance and thus even for large sample sizes
the mean does not converge as demonstrated below the histograms. As a
result the mean for beta.1 is unpredictable and can be far off from its
true
value.

``` r
hist(betas, breaks=c(-20000,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,20000), xlim = c(0, 6), main="Histogram of betas around true value")

We can see from the histogram that adding an error term to the x\_i’s
reduces the values of beta.1 i.e. decreases the slope. This results from
the fact that adding an error term to the x\_i’s increases the bias of
the model and thus decreases the correlation between x and y. The higher
the Variance in the added error term the closer beta.1 will be to zero.
